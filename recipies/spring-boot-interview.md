## What is _Spring Boot_?
*Spring Boot Reference Guide*:
  __Spring Boot__ makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade, Springbased Applications that you can “just run.” We take an opinionated view of
the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with
minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring
configuration.

## What is _spring-boot-starter-parent_?
The _spring-boot-starter-parent_ is used as the parent for the
spring boot application.
The _spring-boot-starter_ will pull in all the core dependencies needed to
start a very basic Spring Boot application, things like the Spring Framework, Logback for
logging, and Spring Boot itself.
